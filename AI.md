# AI contributions

## Summary
The contributors to this project believe that AI-assisted code contributions should be avoided where possible for environmental, ethical and code quality reasons - therefore, any contribution that has been *obviously and entirely generated* by AI tools is likely to be rejected.


## Rationale
- The environmental impact of AI is significant[^1][^2], and any reduction in usage is beneficial.
- AI-generated code is often of lower quality[^3], and may introduce more subtle bugs or security vulnerabilities[^4] than human-written code.
- Relying on AI for code generation can lead to a lack of understanding of the codebase among contributors, which can hinder collaboration and maintenance.
- Most large language models are trained on data that may include copyrighted material[^5], raising potential legal and ethical concerns about the use of AI-generated code[^6].


## Policy
- Contributors **should** avoid using AI tools for generating or significantly modifying code contributions.
- Where a contributor has used AI tools, they **must** clearly disclose this in their contributions.
- Contributors **must** take responsibility for the code they submit - it will reviewed and tested like any other code contribution, and as such **must** be fully understood by the contributor.
- To reduce the burden on maintainers, pull requests/issues that were *obviously and entirely generated* by AI tools **may** be closed without review.


## Definitions
- *Contributor*: Any individual who submits code, documentation, or other contributions to this repository.
- *Obviously generated/significantly modified by AI tools*: Code that exhibits characteristics typical of AI-generated content, such as unnatural phrasing, inconsistent style, or patterns that suggest non-human authorship.
- *AI tools*: Any software or service that uses artificial intelligence to generate or modify code, including but not limited to language models, code completion tools, and automated code generators.
