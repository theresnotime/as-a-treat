# You can have a README, as a treat

## What is?
It's a silly fedi bot (currently at https://fox.nexus/@treats).

## Editing [arrays.py](arrays.py)
The format is *{folx} can have {treats}, as a treat*, so add items to `FOLX` and/or `TREATS`:

```python
FOLX = [
    "Transfems",
    "Foxgirls",
    [...],
]

TREATS = [
    "a headpat",
    "an anti-trust lawsuit",
    [...],
]
```
## Gotchas
- I <3 trailing commas, and `tox` will get very upset if you forget this :3
